## Q. What is SPA?

SPA stands for single page application where the entire UI is compiled into a single page but only the necessary data is visible at a point of time. It can be configured to show and hide data based on the URL routing to make it feel like multi page application.

### Benefits of SPA:

**Dynamic Content Loading**: SPAs use AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) or modern JavaScript frameworks (like React, Angular, or Vue.js) to fetch data from a server and update specific parts of the webpage dynamically without refreshing the entire page.

**Enhanced User Experience**: Since SPAs only load the required content, they tend to provide a faster and smoother user experience compared to traditional multi-page applications. The navigation feels more seamless because the transitions occur within the same page.

**Better Performance**: SPAs reduce the amount of data transferred between the client and server, as they typically retrieve only the necessary data instead of entire HTML pages. This optimization can lead to faster load times and improved performance.

**Separation of Concerns**: They enable a clear separation between the frontend and backend development, allowing for more flexibility and modularity in the development process.
