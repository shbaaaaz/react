# Chapter 2

- Initialize npm and configure bundler
  - use `npm init` to create a configuration file called `package.json`.
  - download parcel (alternative to webpack) bundler as a dev dependency using `npm i -D parcel`
  - Add .gitignore file and add the path of the folder or files that need not be pushed to the code repository.
  - Add a copy of HTML and JS file that we used in chapter-1
  - Run `npx parcel index.html` to run the parcel bundler
